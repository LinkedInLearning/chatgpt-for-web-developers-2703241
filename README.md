Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. It’s a game changer for web developers, too, who can use it to improve the efficiency and productivity of their overall workflows. In this course, join instructor Sandy Ludosky for an introduction to ChatGPT for web developers.

Explore the basics of how ChatGPT works and how to start using it to generate code—coding better and faster than ever before and optimizing the appearance of webpages with CSS. Learn to converse with the ChatGPT UI to create fully realized web applications using JavaScript and ReactJS. Along the way, level up your skills with the exercise challenges at the end of each section. By the end of this course, you’ll also be equipped with new skills for prompt engineering to create next-generation ChatGPT-powered applications.
